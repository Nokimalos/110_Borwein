# 110_Borwein
110 Borwein is the last mathematics project in first year at EPITECH. The goal is  to compute Borwein integrals, using the midpoint rule, the trapezoidal rule and the Simpsonâ€™s rule. Attached you will find unit tests using Criterion which verify 100% coverage as well as bash functional tests.
